// ----- Reference: Arduino built in examples - Blink
// ----- Creating a sensor to detect if user is standing on the right spot, if not, the orange light blink; if yes, green light turn on. 
// ----- With this idea, I created 2 individual circuits. 

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  // ----- I put the orange LED which blink in pin 13, so I put 13 here. 
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
// ----- Because the blink indicates warning, so I changed the delay to 100(0.1 seconds) to warn user that they are standing in the wrong spot. 
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(100);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(100);                       // wait for a second
}
