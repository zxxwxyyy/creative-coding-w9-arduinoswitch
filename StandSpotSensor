// ----- Creating a sensor to detect if user is standing on the right spot, if not, the orange light blink; if yes, green light on with Breath effect.
// ----- With this idea, I created 2 individual circuits, and another one for button. 

// ----- preset variables for each set of pin.

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.

  digitalWrite(greenLight, LOW);// ----- I want to give the green light a "breath" effect, just like my laptop! So I preset the light at LOW in the setup. reference from: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalwrite/;

}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
// ----- Because the blink indicates warning, so I changed the delay to 100(0.1 seconds) to warn user that they are standing in the wrong spot.

  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
